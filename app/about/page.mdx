# About Me

I've been passionate about coding from an early age. For me, coding is like solving intricate puzzles, offering a universal toolkit that bridges diverse domains such as Math and Physics.

One of my earliest projects was a simple HTML and CSS website, created in 4th grade for an inter-class competition. Securing 3rd place was a proud moment that ignited my enthusiasm for web development.

My journey into ethical hacking began with Kali Linux, revealing the fascinating world of cybersecurity. This curiosity about technology led me to disassemble an old PS2 in 6th grade just to understand its workings better.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity about how the world operates, I believe that if Math helps us understand the universe, then a computer acts as the GUI to interact with it.

Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, I've explored a wide array of topics, including web programming, deep learning, blockchain, and quantum computing. My solid foundation in computer science fundamentals, honed through rigorous academic training, has empowered me to tackle these complex subjects effectively.

Problem-solving lies at the core of my approach, and I'm always eager to face challenges head-on and deliver innovative solutions. My ability to adapt, learn, and apply new technologies swiftly makes me a strong candidate for any software development role.

## Beyond Academics

I have a diverse set of skills and hobbies:

- **Basketball**: I played at a national level and won the state championship, and I still enjoy playing recreationally on weekends.
- **Acting**: I have a passion for theater and have starred as the lead in a short film. Check it out here: [My Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvnogCMRnDM&t=314s).
- **Rock Climbing**: I recently started rock climbing and have developed a strong liking for it.
- **Chess**: I enjoy the strategic challenge of chess and play regularly.
