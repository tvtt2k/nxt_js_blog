# About me!
 
I've been into coding since an early age. I love coding because it feels like solving puzzles! Coding is so universal that it can be applied in domains like Math and Physics.

- One of the first projects ever created was a simple HTML and CSS website in 4th grade. There was an inter-class competition, and securing 3rd place in my grade was a proud moment.
- Playing with Kali Linux opened up the world of 'ethical' hacking for me.
- I have been passionate for physics and computers goes way back. I remmeber Disassembling an old PS2 in 6th grade just so I could learn about how it works.
- Curiosity about how the world operates has always driven me. Personally, I believe if Math is our way of understanding the universe, then a computer acts like a GUI to interact with it.
- Throughout my undergrad and graduate school, I explored topics ranging from web programming, deep learning, blockchain, to quantum computing. This journey was bolstered by a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals from my undergrad, which was further sharpened in graduate studies.
- Problem-solving is at the heart of my approach, always eager to tackle challenges head-on and deliver innovative solutions. The ability to adapt, learn, and apply new technologies quickly makes me an ideal candidate for any software development role.

- Apart from academics, there are several skills and hobbies I love:
  - Playing basketball at a national level and won the state [championship](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/in-other-news/081116/oakridge-international-school-boys-champs.html) and continuing to enjoy the sport recreationally, still playing games on some weekends.
  - Acting in theater, including starring as the lead in a short film. Check it out here: [My Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvnogCMRnDM&t=314s).
  - Recently starting rock climbing and developing a liking for it, along with enjoying chess as well.
