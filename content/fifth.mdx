# Professional Experience

## Game Developer Intern – Being Digital, Mumbai, India

During my internship at Being Digital, I delved into the world of game development, where I had the opportunity to craft video game character functionality and design immersive environments. Utilizing C# in conjunction with Unity, I was able to animate dynamic character movements. This process was particularly enlightening as it involved understanding the intricacies of animation fluidity and reducing motion bugs, which significantly improved the user experience.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned during this internship was the importance of rigorous testing and debugging. I diagnosed and tested gameplay glitches across over 50 game levels. This experience underscored the critical nature of unit testing and automated testing frameworks in ensuring a seamless user experience. By optimizing game logic and animation timings, I successfully reduced bug reports by 10%, a testament to the efficacy of thorough testing and debugging.

Additionally, I had the responsibility of composing technical documentation to support our development efforts. This task improved my technical writing skills and highlighted the importance of clear and comprehensive documentation for knowledge transfer and maintaining continuity in development projects.

## Freelance Software Developer – Great State Aleworks, Pune, India

In my role as a freelance software developer, I worked on enhancing the efficiency of message application delivery. By developing custom Python packages and leveraging the Pandas library, I was able to increase delivery efficiency by 26% compared to previous manual methods. This project was a deep dive into Python programming and the power of data manipulation libraries, which expanded my understanding of efficient coding practices and performance optimization.

Maintaining and enhancing database systems using SQL was another significant aspect of this role. I implemented new data insertion protocols to ensure storage efficiency and integrity. This experience reinforced my knowledge of database management and the importance of data integrity in software applications.
